# Predator Prey Model

# Summarry

WIP

This is a model of predators hunting a prey species, inspired by watching my dogs chase rabbits in a field. They weren't very good at cooperating (e.g. chasing from seperate angles to catch the rabbits). I wanted to see if I could implement a fairly simple evolutionary model in which the predators (called "wolves") have a "gene" which determines their behavior, by carrying the parameters for a potential function governing their movement. I was hoping the model could evolve a hunting dynamic, involving cooperation, by implementing some natural selection on the gene strings.
